 *
 * ── Health and wellness classification hygiene ────────────────────────────
 * READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A FIELD.
 *
 * This offer sells against a body: weight, (pre)diabetes, fatty liver,
 * cholesterol, hypothyroidism, insulin resistance. Meta classifies a dataset
 * into its restricted "Health and wellness condition" category by reading a
 * handful of surfaces, and a restriction, once applied, binds at the ROOT
 * DOMAIN and is not cleanly reversible. One careless payload key can cost the
 * client every funnel they will ever run on that domain.
 *
 * The intrinsic nature of the product is a signal nobody can remove. Every
 * signal that CAN be removed is removed, and there are exactly two this file
 * owns:
 *
 *   `custom_data` carries value, currency and order_id ONLY, and on this
 *   build it carries no money at all, so an order id is the whole of it. No
 *   `content_name`, no product string, no category, no UTM, no fbclid.
 *   custom_data is NOT hashed and IS read. A product string reading
 *   "12-Week Fatty Liver and Metabolic Reset" arriving on every event is a
 *   plain-text declaration of the condition, and `utm_campaign` is worse,
 *   because media buyers write those and they drift toward symptom language
 *   with nobody reviewing them.
 *
 *   `event_source_url` is reduced to the ORIGIN, server-side. A path naming a
 *   condition carries the same declaration in the same crawl. It is done
 *   server-side rather than trusted from the caller, because the caller is a
 *   browser posting `window.location.href`, which is precisely the value with
 *   the path and the fbclid on it.
 *
 * `user_data` is untouched and stays MAXIMAL. It is all SHA-256 hashed, it is
 * what EMQ is scored on, and it declares nothing about the offer. Hygiene
 * means removing description, never removing matching.
 *
 * The standard event NAMES are deliberately kept. Coded custom events
 * (`evt_a`) are the belt-and-braces variant of this posture and they are the
 * wrong trade: they forfeit Aggregated Event Measurement priority, the
 * built-in Lead optimisation and every standard-event prior in the ad
 * account. The payload and the URL are where the classification risk lives;
 * the names are where the performance lives.

 * Nothing is sold here. The India build's terminal conversion was a captured
 * payment; this funnel's is a REGISTRATION, so `Lead` replaces it, and
 * `Schedule` marks the booking that follows. Both are standard names, so they
 * keep Aggregated Event Measurement priority and every standard-event prior in
 * the ad account, which is exactly why coded custom events were rejected in
 * the note at the top of this file.

 * this build that is fired from a server route with the person's own details
 * proven by their submission rather than announced by their browser.

/**
 * Custom events, kept to a closed union for the same reason the standard ones
 * are: a free-form string is how a health term eventually reaches Meta as an
 * event name, which is the surface that gets a dataset classified.
 *
 * ── QualifiedLead is WIRED BUT NOT FIRED on this build. ──────────────────
 * The mechanism is complete: the registration route validates the answer and
 * forwards it. What is missing is the client decision it depends on.
 * QualifiedLead is a segment label on an existing step, fired at the same
 * instant as `Lead` for the half of the registrations the client works with
 * most, and NOBODY HAS SAID which half that is for Deepti.
 *
 * A free offer makes this MORE useful than it was on the India build, not
 * less: ninety-seven rupees filtered the list by itself, and nothing filters
 * this one. The filter has to come from a field or from the assessment call.
 *
 * It is still deliberately not invented here, for two reasons. Inventing a
 * qualifying question puts a made-up field on a live form, and the obvious
 * candidates for a metabolic-health offer ("what is your primary concern",
 * "do you have recent blood reports") name a condition in custom_data, which
 * is the exact surface this file exists to keep clean. Occupation is safe but
 * means nothing to this offer.
 *
 * Turning it on later is: add the select to the registration form, pass
 * `occupation` through to /api/register, and nothing else. Known price when
 * you do: one Aggregated Event Measurement slot on iOS, where standard events
 * rank above custom ones.
