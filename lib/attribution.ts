/**
 * First-touch attribution, captured once and remembered.
 *
 * The problem this solves: reading the CURRENT url at the form returns
 * nothing. On /register there is no query string, because the visitor
 * navigated there from the landing page by clicking a link. So every UTM, the
 * fbclid and the referrer, the entire answer to "which ad produced this
 * registration", evaporates one click after arrival, and the record is written
 * with blank campaign fields. Every paid registration then reports as organic.
 *
 * So the campaign context is stamped into localStorage on FIRST landing, on
 * whichever page that happens to be, and read back at the form.
 *
 * Overwrite rule: a visit carrying a utm_source or an fbclid is a new ad click
 * and replaces what is stored. Last paid click wins, which is what the ad
 * account is judged on. A visit with neither (a direct return, a bookmark, an
 * organic search) leaves the stored campaign ALONE rather than blanking it.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   THE EDGE LAYER (ported from ResetByShruti, 2026-09-22)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Everything above this line runs in the BROWSER, from a React effect. That
   is the layer that was losing data, and it loses it in a way that is biased
   against exactly the traffic we pay for.

   On a heavy landing page inside the Instagram or Facebook in-app browser, a
   visitor can tap the CTA and navigate away BEFORE hydration runs the capture
   above. localStorage is also the first thing those browsers restrict. Either
   way the campaign, the landing url and the referrer are gone by the time the
   checkout asks for them, and the buyer arrives at Pabbly with blank columns.

   So the same values are now ALSO written at the edge, on the first request,
   before a line of JavaScript runs. `middleware.ts` calls these. The browser
   capture stays exactly as it was and becomes the redundant copy rather than
   the only one.

   ONE COOKIE, TWO WRITERS, so both must agree on the shape: it is the same
   `Attribution` object, JSON, under the same name as the storage key.
