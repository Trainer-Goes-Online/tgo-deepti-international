/**
 * First-touch attribution, captured once and remembered.
 *
 * The problem this solves: reading the CURRENT url at the form returns
 * nothing. On /register there is no query string, because the visitor
 * navigated there from the landing page by clicking a link. So every UTM, the
 * fbclid and the referrer, the entire answer to "which ad produced this
 * registration", evaporates one click after arrival, and the record is written
 * with blank campaign fields. Every paid registration then reports as organic.
 *
 * So the campaign context is stamped into localStorage on FIRST landing, on
 * whichever page that happens to be, and read back at the form.
 *
 * Overwrite rule: a visit carrying a utm_source or an fbclid is a new ad click
 * and replaces what is stored. Last paid click wins, which is what the ad
 * account is judged on. A visit with neither (a direct return, a bookmark, an
 * organic search) leaves the stored campaign ALONE rather than blanking it.
