/**
 * THE CONFIRMATION · /thank-you
 *
 * ── WHERE IT SITS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   /register -> REGISTRATION -> /book-a-call -> BOOKING -> /thank-you
 *
 * By the time anyone lands here they have registered AND booked, so the only
 * thing left to influence is whether they turn up prepared. Every push to
 * book is gone: on a page reached only by booking, a "book your slot"
 * button is a bug.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING THIS PAGE CARRIES THAT THE INDIA BUILD'S DOES NOT ────
 * The weight of a free booking. Nobody paid to be here, so the no-show cost
 * is zero and the only thing holding the slot is the reader's own intention.
 * That is why the prep beat is the longest one on the page: a person who has
 * gathered their reports has already started, and a person who has started
 * turns up.
 *
 * ── REBUILT 2026-09-09 TO THE LANDING PAGE'S OWN SYSTEM ────────────────
 * The previous version was structurally fine and visually anonymous: small
 * flat cards, no eyebrows, no band rhythm, none of the funnel's signatures.
 * It read like a different company's confirmation page.
 *
 * It now mirrors the SDP anatomy in `landing.css` beat for beat, measured
 * from it rather than approximated:
 *   · eyebrows are mono, uppercase, with the 24x2 accent dash before them
 *   · section headings are Fraunces, centred, one italic accent word
 *   · a deck at 680px under each, then 44px of air
 *   · sections are 80px tall and alternate band tone the way the funnel does
 *   · big display ordinals with a short gold rule under them, exactly the
 *     `.sdp-pillar-num` treatment from the programme beat
 *   · the confirmation seal is built like the guarantee card's icon tile:
 *     a dark garnet tile with a gold mark on it
 *
 * BAND RHYTHM: dark (confirmation) · light (what the call is) · blush
 * (prep) · dark (close). The page opens AND closes on the deepest surface,
 * which is the funnel's own way of marking a beat that matters.
 *
 * The "email your reports" section was removed on Atul's instruction.
 *
 * Everything describing the assessment is verbatim from the copy source.
 * The connective copy is mine and is worth a NO-BRAINER pass.
