/* The medical disclaimer is clause 02, not an afterthought at the end. This
   page sells a nutrition programme to people managing diabetes, thyroid
   conditions, fatty liver and hypertension, and the landing copy uses the
   words "healing your liver". The single most important thing these terms do
   is state that this is nutrition and lifestyle guidance, that it does not
   replace their doctor, and that they should not stop medication because of
   anything here. That protects the reader first and the business second.

   ⚠ CLAUSE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING ON THIS PAGE. The prose cites "clause 02"
   (the health disclaimer) and "clause 06" (what we ask of you) in its own
   sentences, and the ordinals are rendered from array position. Reordering
   or inserting a clause silently breaks two cross-references, so check
   those two sentences whenever this array changes. It is also why the
   clause marker keeps its mono ordinal rather than only the accent bar the
   blueprint calls for. */

            Tell us about your medical conditions and your medication before you

            disorder, kidney disease, liver failure or any condition requiring
            a medically supervised diet, speak to your doctor before starting
            and tell us what they advise.
