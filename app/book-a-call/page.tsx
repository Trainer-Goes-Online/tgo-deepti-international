/**
 * THE SIXTH SURFACE · /book-a-call
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS SITS IN THE FLOW ────────────────────────────────────────
 *   /register -> REGISTRATION -> /book-a-call?r=<lead_id> -> BOOKING -> /thank-you
 *
 * This is the first page after the registration, which gives it two jobs
 * beyond the calendar:
 *   1. It fires the BOOKING events, Meta's `Schedule` and GA4's
 *      `booking_confirmed`, at the moment Cal reports a completed booking.
 *      They are NOT fired on arrival: arriving here means somebody registered,
 *      which /api/register already counted as the `Lead`. Firing on mount
 *      would report a booking for every person who looked at a calendar.
 *   2. It carries the registration id forward, so the thank-you can key on it
 *      after Cal hands the visitor back.
 *
 * ── HOW THE INDIA BUILD DIFFERS ────────────────────────────────────────
 * There this page sits behind a ₹97 payment and fires the GA4 purchase on
 * arrival, because arriving IS the conversion there. Here the assessment is
 * free, the conversion happened one page earlier, and the gap this page has to
 * close is wider: a person who paid has a reason to come back tomorrow, and a
 * person who paid nothing has only their own intention. Everything below the
 * calendar is what stands in for the ninety-seven rupees.
 *
 * Rebuilt 2026-09-09 to the anatomy of vsl.teamfitarjun.com/book-a-call,
 * which Atul named as the house standard for this route. Route name matched
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE REFERENCE GETS RIGHT, AND WHY IT IS COPIED ────────────────
 * The page is NOT a calendar with a heading on it. It is a page whose whole
 * job is to convert a REGISTERED visitor into a BOOKED one, because the gap
 * between those two is where a funnel quietly loses the people it already
 * captured. That is why the reference spends most of its length after the
 * calendar: proof, what the call gets you, a nudge, an objection or two,
 * and a CTA that scrolls back up. Every one of those exists to stop
 * somebody closing the tab meaning to come back on Monday.
 *
 * Structure taken from it, in order: confirmation strip, step dots, pill,
 * two-line headline with an italic accent line, deck, THE CALENDAR CARD
 * (header, embed, three reassurances inside the card), proof, a
 * scroll-back CTA, a numbered "what you walk away with", a booking nudge,
 * an objection pair, a closing CTA card, footer.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED ────────────────────────────────────
 * · No logo lockup. Atul removed the wordmark from the build; there is no
 *   mark to put here, and a placeholder is what he asked to be rid of.
 * · No "38% of people who register never show up". That is the reference's own
 *   measured number. Deepti has no such figure, and inventing a statistic
 *   on a live page is inventing a client fact. The nudge makes the same
 *   argument without a number.
 * · No written testimonial quote. Deepti's testimonials are films, and the
 *   source copy carries no pull quote. An invented one is a fabricated
 *   review, so the slot is left out rather than filled.
 *
 * Everything describing the assessment is the client's own words from
 * FAQ 1 of the landing copy. The connective copy is mine and is worth a
 * NO-BRAINER pass.

         Cal's own dashboard. If that is ever set it WINS over this, so set it
