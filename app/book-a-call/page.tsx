/**
 * THE SIXTH SURFACE · /book-a-call
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS SITS IN THE FLOW ────────────────────────────────────────
 *   /register -> REGISTRATION -> /book-a-call?r=<lead_id> -> BOOKING -> /thank-you
 *
 * This is the first page after the registration, which gives it two jobs
 * beyond the calendar:
 *   1. It fires the BOOKING events, Meta's `Schedule` and GA4's
 *      `booking_confirmed`, at the moment Cal reports a completed booking.
 *      They are NOT fired on arrival: arriving here means somebody registered,
 *      which /api/register already counted as the `Lead`. Firing on mount
 *      would report a booking for every person who looked at a calendar.
 *   2. It carries the registration id forward, so the thank-you can key on it
 *      after Cal hands the visitor back.
 *
 * ── HOW THE INDIA BUILD DIFFERS ────────────────────────────────────────
 * There this page sits behind a ₹97 payment and fires the GA4 purchase on
 * arrival, because arriving IS the conversion there. Here the assessment is
 * free, the conversion happened one page earlier, and the gap this page has to
 * close is wider: a person who paid has a reason to come back tomorrow, and a
 * person who paid nothing has only their own intention. Everything below the
 * calendar is what stands in for the ninety-seven rupees.
 *
 * Rebuilt 2026-09-09 to the anatomy of vsl.teamfitarjun.com/book-a-call,
 * which Atul named as the house standard for this route. Route name matched
 * for the same reason.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE REFERENCE GETS RIGHT, AND WHY IT IS COPIED ────────────────
 * The page is NOT a calendar with a heading on it. It is a page whose whole
 * job is to convert a REGISTERED visitor into a BOOKED one, because the gap
 * between those two is where a funnel quietly loses the people it already
 * captured. That is why the reference spends most of its length after the
 * calendar: proof, what the call gets you, a nudge, an objection or two,
 * and a CTA that scrolls back up. Every one of those exists to stop
 * somebody closing the tab meaning to come back on Monday.
 *
 * Structure taken from it, in order: confirmation strip, step dots, pill,
 * two-line headline with an italic accent line, deck, THE CALENDAR CARD
 * (header, embed, three reassurances inside the card), proof, a
 * scroll-back CTA, a numbered "what you walk away with", a booking nudge,
 * an objection pair, a closing CTA card, footer.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT COPIED ────────────────────────────────────
 * · No logo lockup. Atul removed the wordmark from the build; there is no
 *   mark to put here, and a placeholder is what he asked to be rid of.
 * · No "38% of people who register never show up". That is the reference's own
 *   measured number. Deepti has no such figure, and inventing a statistic
 *   on a live page is inventing a client fact. The nudge makes the same
 *   argument without a number.
 * · No written testimonial quote. Deepti's testimonials are films, and the
 *   source copy carries no pull quote. An invented one is a fabricated
 *   review, so the slot is left out rather than filled.
 *
 * Everything describing the assessment is the client's own words from
 * FAQ 1 of the landing copy. The connective copy is mine and is worth a
 * NO-BRAINER pass.

   ONE line to change if the handle or event ever changes.

   IT IS ITS OWN EVENT, not the India one. The slug ends
   `-international`, so this funnel's bookings land on a separate cal.com

   looks: the audience is USA, Canada, UK, Australia and the Gulf, so the
   hours this event offers are the whole difference between a bookable
   calendar and an empty one.

   Moved off cal.id on 2026-09-19. Note for any future move: the loader

  /* ── THE EMBED BOOTS ONCE, AND ONLY ONCE (2026-09-19) ────────────────
     Ported from the India build, where this was a live bug.

     Cal's `inline` command MOUNTS an embed into #dp-cal. Calling it twice
     does not refresh the first one, it puts a second instance in the same
     container, and the two then fight over what the container shows: one
     advances to the questions after a slot is tapped, the other re-renders
     the month view underneath it. What the visitor sees is the form appear
     and then snap straight back to slot selection, every time.

     It was being called twice. reactStrictMode is on, and in development
     StrictMode deliberately runs every effect, cleans it up and runs it
     AGAIN to surface exactly this class of bug. The cleanup here only
     cleared the poll; it never tore the embed down, so the second run
     mounted a second embed on top of the first.

     The ref survives StrictMode's remount of the same component instance,
     so the second run skips the boot. A genuine unmount and remount gets a
     fresh component, a fresh ref, and a correct re-boot. */

         Cal's own dashboard. If that is ever set it WINS over this, so set it
