        This build serves visitors in the UK, the EEA, Canada, Australia and the
        United States, and health data is a special category under several of
        those laws. What is missing is a decision, not a sentence: which regimes
        Deepti intends to accept clients under, what lawful basis and transfer
        mechanism she relies on for each, and whether a data-protection
        representative is needed in the UK or the EU. That is a question for a
        solicitor in those jurisdictions. Nothing is invented here in the
        meantime: the clause above states only what is factually true of where
        the information goes.
