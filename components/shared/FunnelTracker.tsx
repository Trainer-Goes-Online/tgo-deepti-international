/**
 * Landing-page tracking, mounted once on the page. Renders nothing.
 *
 * ONLY ViewContent lives here. AddToCart does NOT: it fires from the
 * registration page's own mount, for two reasons.
 *
 *  1. This page carries seven CTA lockups. A reader who clicked two of them
 *     would count twice, which inflates AddToCart volume and deflates the
 *     cost-per-AddToCart the ads are judged on.
 *  2. A click is not an arrival. Counting the registration page's mount counts
 *     the people who actually reached it, and it is the only Meta event a
 *     visitor who opens /register directly will ever produce.
 *
 * Do not re-add it here: the two together double-count every ordinary visitor.
