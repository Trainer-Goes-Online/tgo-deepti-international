/**
 * BEATS 3 / 4 · PROOF.
 *
 * Shape: PROOF-SET, twice over. TWO kinds of evidence, so two exhibit
 * forms (the blueprint's vary-adjacent-proof rule, applied inside one
 * section):
 *   A · 15 video testimonials  the client says it in their own face
 *   B · 32 before and afters   the same person, a year apart
 *
 * ── CHANGED 2026-09-09 (Atul) ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * The designed case-study cards are GONE, and so is the blood-report half
 * of the old paired exhibit. What was a three-group section built around
 * placeholders is now two groups built around assets that actually exist.
 *
 * Dropping the reports also drops a launch blocker with them: those images
 * carried patient names and needed redacting before they could ship.
 *
 * ── WHY THE BEFORE AND AFTERS ARE NOT CROPPED ──────────────────────────
 * They arrive at every ratio from 0.66 to 2.91, and most of them carry the
 * client's own words burned into the image. A uniform tile with
 * object-fit:cover would slice those captions off, which on a proof beat
 * means cropping away the actual testimony. So the rail is a FIXED HEIGHT
 * and every image keeps its own width. Ragged widths are the correct
 * outcome here: it reads as a set of real photographs rather than a
 * designed grid, which is what this evidence is.
 *
 * Server component.

/* ── WRITTEN CASE STUDIES (2026-09-19, Atul) ───────────────────────────
 * Ported from the India build. The video rail shows faces; these show the
 * markers. Both are the same proof beat, so they live in the same section,
 * but a reader scanning for "did it work on someone with MY report" cannot
 * get that from a thumbnail.
 *
 * COPY IS THE CLIENT'S, REPRODUCED VERBATIM. Ages, star counts, bodies and
 * every stat line are exactly as supplied.
 *
 * THE FIGURES ARE IN KG AND INDIAN CLINICAL GRADES, on a page written for
 * clients outside India. That is deliberate and it is not a mistake to
 * "fix": these are real people Deepti actually treated, and converting a
 * measured weight to pounds would be editing someone's medical record to
 * suit a reader. Flagged to Atul rather than changed.
 *
 * EACH STAT IS ONE WHOLE STRING, not a value/label pair. Most of these lines
 * would split into a figure and a caption ("GRADE 3 → GRADE 1" over "FATTY
 * LIVER"), but several would not ("URIC ACID → NORMAL RANGE"). Splitting the
 * ones that fit and inventing a caption for the rest is how a proof beat ends
 * up with words the client never wrote. So the line is kept whole and the
 * arrow carries the emphasis instead.

            THE TRACK IS DOUBLED, from 2026-09-12. It was a single copy
            running an animation that translates -50%, so the rail drifted
            left by half its own width and then SNAPPED back seven tiles.
            Every other rail on this page (the wins wall, the before-afters,
            the credential marquee) is doubled for exactly this reason; this
            one was the odd one out, and the snap is what made the counter-
            scroll against the before-after rail unreadable.

            Thirty players rather than fifteen is affordable because every
            tile is `loading="lazy"`: the second copy costs nothing until it
            approaches the viewport. The duplicate is `inert` as well as
            aria-hidden, which is also what PART 3's reduced-motion rule
            looks for when it drops the spare half. */}
