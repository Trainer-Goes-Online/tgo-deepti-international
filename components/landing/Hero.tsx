 * BEAT 1 — HERO / VSL.
 *
 * Shape: FOCAL MEDIA. §8, the heaviest composite on the page: the whole
 * beat exists to hand the reader to the film and then, the moment the
 * film ends, to the button.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE CLIENT'S AND IS FIXED, top to bottom:
 *   audience-gate pill → two-tier H1 → deck → pre-video line →
 *   marker chips → watch cue → VSL → CTA lockup → credibility table
 *
 * The post-video order matters more than it looks: the CTA sits directly
 * under the film because that is the second the reader is most persuaded,
 * and the four-stat credibility table sits AFTER it, as the thing that
 * catches whoever scrolled past the button rather than as a warm-up
 * before it.
 *
 * Server component. The only client parts are the film and the countdown.

   ON THE INDIA BUILD THAT CARD READS "₹97 · To Start", read from an env var
   through lib/site.ts, because a price has to be declared in exactly one
   place. Here it is the literal word FREE, written once, right here, and
   nothing else in the build declares it. There is no fee constant to keep it
   in step with, because there is no fee.

   THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THE LANDING PAGE SAYS IT, and it is not a price: it
   is the answer to the question the reader is holding while they watch the
   film. The `is-price` treatment stays, because that tint is what makes the
   eye land on the card, and on a cold international audience this is the
   strongest thing on the page.

   The claim above it, "700+ clients across India, USA, Canada, UK, Australia
   & The Middle East", is the client's own and stays exactly as it is. */
