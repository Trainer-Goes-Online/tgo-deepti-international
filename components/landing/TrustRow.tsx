/**
 * BEAT 0b — TRUST ROW.
 *
 * Shape: credential set. Category §12 Authority, lightest option — a
 * hairline trust-chip row directly under the announcement strip.
 *
 * Copy (verbatim):
 *   "[Photos] ★★★★★ 5.0 Review | 🛡️ 100% Results Guarantee"
 *
 * The "[Photos]" the copy asks for are client reviewer portraits, and
 * none exist yet. They render as dashed accent rings: a slot that reads
 * as PENDING. They are deliberately not stock faces and not blank grey
 * circles that could pass for real anonymous reviewers — on a page whose
 * entire pitch is honest health claims, a fake face is the most expensive
 * pixel we could ship. When the real portraits land, drop the URLs into
 * AVATARS below; the ring geometry (32px, -6px overlap, face-crop
 * background-position) is already the shipped one, so nothing reflows.
 *
 * Server component, no client JS: this sits above the fold and must paint
 * immediately.
 */

/** Reviewer portraits, in order.
 *
 * Real clients, cropped from the before/after photographs already published
 * in the proof beat, so this introduces no new faces and no stock people.
 * Two candidates were rejected outright because the client had masked the
 * eyes out of their own photo: those two asked not to be identifiable, and a
 * trust row is the last place to overrule that.
 *
 * Each file is a 128px square already centred on the face, which is why
 * PART 3h drops the 140% zoom PART 2 applies to raw portraits. */
