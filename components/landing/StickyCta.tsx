/**
 * BEAT 12 · STICKY CTA. Page-chrome, not a section.
 *
 * ── ALWAYS ON, from 2026-09-09 (Atul) ─────────────────────────────────
 * It used to stay hidden until the hero had scrolled away and retreat
 * again at the finale. Both observers are gone, and that takes the whole
 * client island with them: with nothing to show or hide there is no
 * state, no useEffect and no JS. It is a server component now, so the bar
 * paints with the first frame instead of after hydration.
 *
 * TWO THINGS THAT ONLY MATTER BECAUSE IT NEVER RETREATS:
 *  · The page needs a spacer. `.sdp-root` takes bottom padding in PART 3g,
 *    or the bar sits permanently on top of the finale, and the finale is
 *    where SiteFooter carries the registered name, address, phone and
 *    email the funnel promises a stranger it is a real practice. A bar
 *    covering those is a bar that hides the only proof of that on the page.
 *  · The button is no longer focus-trapped. `tabIndex` used to flip to -1
 *    while the bar was hidden so a keyboard user could not tab into an
 *    invisible control. Always visible means always tabbable, so it goes.
 *
 * ── SHAPE, from vsl.teamfitarjun.com's bar (measured, not eyeballed) ───
 * A LIGHT cream bar, not dark glass: a 1px warm border along the top, a
 * soft upward shadow, a CENTRED pill button, and two risk badges under
 * it. Ours previously ran a price tag left and the button right with a
 * shine sweeping the top edge; the tag's space goes to the badges, and
 * the sweep was drawn to read across dark glass and does nothing on
 * cream.
 *
 * The badges are the first two from the CTA lockup, so the bar still
 * introduces no copy that is not already the client's own.

            Every CTA on the page carries the offer deadline, and this bar
            is a CTA. It reads the same stored deadline as the seven lockup
            timers, so the bar and the section it is floating over never
            disagree about how long is left.

            It sits on the badge ROW rather than under it, so the bar grows
            by the difference between a 20px badge line and the chip, not by
            a whole extra row. Below 640 the badges drop out, as they always
            did, and the chip is the only thing on that row.

            THE PAGE'S BOTTOM RESERVE MOVED WITH IT, in PART 3l. The reserve
            is measured from the bar's own parts, and a bar that grew without
            it would cover the finale, where SiteFooter carries the details
            a visitor abroad checks the practice by. */}
